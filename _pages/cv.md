Main project experience
======
* Multimodal Feature Fusion Mining and Scene Interpretation of Remote Sensing Image (National Natural Science Foundation of China) 2020.03-2022.06  
(1) Based on multi-layer nearest neighbor graph retrieval, a semi-supervised multi-domain fusion graph network is proposed to model the polarization and spatial features of remote sensing images under a very small number of labeled samples. Achieved SOTA in the remote sensing image feature classification task, and the results have been submitted to the top journal TIP. [See details](https://tangrui2018.github.io/publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-3)  
(2) Multi-modal unsupervised scale learning is proposed to extract the characteristics of spatial distribution homogeneity of remote sensing images, explore the characteristics of eigenmodes, spatial modes and density modes of remote sensing images, and combine nearest neighbor graph retrieval to achieve unsupervised Representation and classification of remote sensing images, and the results have been submitted to TGRS, a top journal. [See details](https://tangrui2018.github.io/publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-2)  
(3) Propose an unsupervised spontaneous clustering network, called deep graph clustering. Combine spatial information and polarization coherence matrix to represent and cluster data, and realize classification without labeled samples. It has 9%-11% accuracy improvement on multiple PolSAR data sets. The research results have been submitted to the EI conference [See details]( https://tangrui2018.github.io/publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-1)  
* Construction of warehouse autonomous driving robot control system 2020.06-2021.12  
(1) In a fixed warehouse environment, multiple vehicles are dynamically planned, and autonomous driving is used to complete the task of cargo transportation. Divided into input layer, AI planning layer, AI execution layer  
(2) The input layer obtains the starting point and destination of transportation through speech recognition, the AI planning layer realizes multi-objective path planning in a fixed environment through reinforcement learning, the AI execution layer accepts the path of the AI planning layer, and performs reinforcement learning through data such as images and laser sensors , to achieve self-driving transport of goods.   
(3) I am the main person in charge of the project, mainly responsible for the work: scheme formulation, Unity simulation environment construction, AI planning layer reinforcement algorithm design, AI execution layer control algorithm design, AI execution layer reinforcement learning algorithm design and implementation. [See details](https://tangrui2018.github.io/project/project-1/)  
* Research on security technology for satellite space-ground integrated network 2020.01-2021.12  
(1) Design the group key management scheme of the satellite network to protect the key distribution and key update messages. The research results have passed the expert review, and the national defense patent application is pending; In the case of access and identity authentication schemes, the research results have been formed and the research report has passed expert review
